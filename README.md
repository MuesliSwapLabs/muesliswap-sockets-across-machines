# Muesliswap HTTPS Sockets

Inspired by [cardano-node-socket-over-https](https://gimbalabs.com/dandelion/endpoints/cardano-node-socket)

Basically a set of scripts that allows one to relatively easily map sockets via ssh between a server running a cardano node and a client that needs access to the corresponding socket
