# Beta Program Report
## MuesliSwap Sockets Across Machines

### Overview
The beta testing phase for the *MuesliSwap Sockets Across Machines* tool has been completed, and the repository has been finalized with several key improvements based on user feedback and internal reviews. This update provides enhanced usability, flexibility, and reliability, addressing several user-reported issues and adding new functionality. You can view the finalized repository at [MuesliSwap Sockets Across Machines GitHub](https://github.com/MuesliSwapLabs/muesliswap-sockets-across-machines).

### Summary of Changes

1. **Improved Formatting and Code Structure:**
   - The repository’s codebase has been refined for readability and maintainability. This includes cleaning up import statements and debugging information across all main files.
   - Formatting changes were applied to streamline the overall structure, as seen in the files `bind_remote_socket/__main__.py`, `connection.py`, `forwarder.py`, `socat.py`, and `types.py`.

2. **Enhanced Argument Handling:**
   - Users encountered issues while attempting unsupported variations of socket mappings, particularly when mapping between remote SSH and local sockets. Enhanced argument handling now provides clear restrictions, guiding users towards supported usage patterns—specifically, SSH-remote to local socket mappings.

3. **Optional Sudo Usage via Environment Variables:**
   - Based on user feedback, especially from those who lack sudo access on remote systems, sudo usage has been made optional. This can now be configured via environment variables, allowing flexibility to enable or disable sudo on either the remote or client side.
   - These changes aim to improve accessibility, particularly for users operating in environments with restricted permissions.

### User Feedback Integration

- **Sudo Requirement Flexibility:** 
  - Users requested that sudo access be made optional to support environments without root privileges. This feedback led to the implementation of environment variable-based sudo control, enhancing tool accessibility.

- **Bug Fix: Remote Socket Creation Failure:** 
  - A reported bug where specifying an SSH path as the initial argument failed to create a socket file remotely has been addressed. The updated argument handling and code restructuring aim to resolve this issue, enabling smoother operation.

- **General Positive Feedback:**
  - The simplicity of the setup was well-received, confirming that the tool's installation and configuration process aligns with user expectations.

### Commit Details
Key updates were implemented through the following commits:

- **Commit `1df1bc03bd2052080d226cb136adbf843bc11606`:** 
  - Introduced sudo control via environment variables, improved argument handling, and refined code for enhanced user guidance on supported usage patterns.
  
- **Commit `05e412b609940a4f664bab170a895f0abe97ca8c`:**
  - Cleaned up formatting across various modules, standardizing code structure for readability and consistency.

### Affected Files and Changes Summary
- **`README.md`:** Documentation was updated to reflect the optional sudo configuration and usage guidelines.
- **`bind_remote_socket/__main__.py`, `connection.py`, `socat.py`, `types.py`:** Code improvements, formatting adjustments, and enhanced argument parsing to support new functionality and handle unsupported use cases gracefully.

### Conclusion
This beta phase has successfully refined the *MuesliSwap Sockets Across Machines* tool, addressing key user needs and preparing the repository for broader use. We appreciate all feedback received and are committed to continuous improvement based on user experiences.
