## List of Challenge KPIs and How the Project Addressed Them

### **1:** Develop a Secure Method for Sharing `node.socket` Across Machines

- **Addressed By**: The project successfully created the SAM (Sockets Across Machines) tool, enabling secure sharing of the `node.socket` file over a network. By utilizing SSH for encrypted connections and `socat` for effective socket forwarding, the tool ensures secure communication between distributed systems.

### **2:** Ensure Tool Usability and Community Adoption

- **Addressed By**: The tool operates via a simple command-line interface and requires minimal configuration using a environment variables and CLI arguments. Comprehensive documentation and a usage guide have been provided in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/MuesliSwapLabs/muesliswap-sockets-across-machines), making it accessible to users with varying technical expertise.

### **3:** Address Dependency Management and Error Diagnostics

- **Addressed By**: The script includes checks for necessary dependencies like `socat` on both local and remote machines, preventing execution failures due to missing components. Enhanced error handling and informative messages guide users through setup and potential issues.

### **4:** Provide Educational Resources and Documentation

- **Addressed By**: Detailed documentation, including installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips, is available on the project's GitHub repository. This empowers users to understand the tool's functionality and integrate it into their workflows effectively.

## List of Project KPIs and How the Project Addressed Them

### **1:** Demonstrate Feasibility of Remote `node.socket` Sharing

- **Addressed By**: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) successfully demonstrated that remote socket communication is feasible. The tool allows the Cardano CLI to communicate with a remote node, confirming that the underlying concept works without significant issues.

### **2:** Automate Connection Handling Without Manual Intervention

- **Addressed By**: The tool was enhanced to handle new connections seamlessly, eliminating the need for manual restarts. By addressing `socat`'s limitation of single connection initiation, the script now supports continuous operation, improving practicality for end-users.

### **3:** Optimize Performance and Reliability

- **Addressed By**: Process management has been optimized by executing socket mapping and port forwarding in the background. Strategic delays ensure stability, and cleanup procedures safely terminate all related processes, preventing residual resource consumption.

### **4:** Facilitate Community Collaboration and Engagement

- **Addressed By**: By open-sourcing the tool on GitHub and providing comprehensive documentation, the project invites community involvement. Users can contribute to development, report issues, and suggest enhancements, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.
